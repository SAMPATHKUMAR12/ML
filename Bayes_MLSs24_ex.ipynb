        " In this exercise, you're not on the field kicking the ball, but rather analyzing the game's statistics to uncover hidden insights. Your mission is to estimate the proportion of goals scored by a team in a series of matches using Bayesian inference. Imagine you're a football analyst trying to understand how effective a team is at scoring goals. To do this, you'll use a unique approachâ€”analyzing a sequence of matches and recording whether the team scores a goal or not.\n",

        "Your goal is to develop a Bayesian updating function to estimate the proportion of goals scored by a football team based on the sequence of matches played. Additionally, you'll create a visualization to track how the Bayesian model refines its estimate as more matches are analyzed.\n",
